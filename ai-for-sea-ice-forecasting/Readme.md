## Tutorial
This tutorial is designed to accompany an invited author contribution for Earth Science and AI community. Preprint of the tutorial can be shared on request. Please email jianwu@umbc.edu or sali9@umbc.edu if interested.


## Code
The tutorial will walk you through following previous and newly developed data-driven models proposed by BDAL for Sea Ice Forecasting.
1. [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/blob/main/probabilistic-modeling/models/MLR.ipynb) (details available in our [github project](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/blob/main/probabilistic-modeling/))
2. Long Short Term Memory Model (details available in our [github project](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/blob/main/climate-change-ai-workshop/models/Polar_Sea_Ice_Prediction_mLSTM.ipynb))
