This repository enlists some of the ongoing research projects at [Big Data Analytics Lab](https://bdal.umbc.edu/) for Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting. We have provided code for 2 of such projects including:

1. Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting using [Attention-based Ensemble LSTM](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/climate-change-ai-workshop)
2. Comparative Analysis of [Probabilistic Machine Learning models](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/probabilistic-modeling) for predicting Arctic Sea Ice.
