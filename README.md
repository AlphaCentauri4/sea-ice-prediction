This repository enlists some of the ongoing research projects at [Big Data Analytics Lab](https://bdal.umbc.edu/) for Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting. We have provided code for multiple such projects including:

1. Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting using [Attention-based Ensemble LSTM](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/climate-change-ai-workshop)
2. Comparative Analysis of [Probabilistic Machine Learning models](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/probabilistic-modeling) for predicting Arctic Sea Ice.
3. A Hands-on tutorial for beginners to practice state-of-the-art [AI techniques to forecast Arctic Sea Ice.](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/ai-for-sea-ice-forecasting)
4. [Physics-guided Machine Learning](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/physics-guided-ML) for Sea Ice Forecasting
5. [MT-IceNet](https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/mt-icenet) - A Spatial and Multi-Temporal Deep Learning Model for Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting
